[TODO]
- Interface with camera
	- start to use for LED detection
- determine error problem with motor controller
- test line following system
- develop sampling equation for handling sporadic inputs
	- variable number of samples with outlier elimination
- develop strategy for navigating center 4-way turn
- Develop strategy for determining victims position in room
	- EM detection, LED detection, and IR's can be used
- Develop strategy for leaving room
	-Probably using IR's to get back on the outside line
- create computer side controller for testing
- interface with EM field detector
- interface with gyro
	- can be used to help turn
- introduce hazard avoidance/handling
	- using varying height IR sensors
- store constants in eeprom
- add debug operating mode where eeprom constants can
  be programmed and robot can be manually driven
- combine computer-side and avr-side processes to create test case suite


[DELAYED]
- order speaker
- interface with speaker
